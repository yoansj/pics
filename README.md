# Pics

## Whats Pics

Pics is my first React project, the aim of this project is to create a nice diaporama to showcase some pictures i've posted on my [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/rboypics/).

To build the project I used some UI librairies, Bootstrap React and Material UI.

[See the project](https://yoansj.github.io/pics/)

### Learning React

I learned React mainly by reading the [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) at first.

I really had a lot of issues with the visuals of the app but overall it went well.
